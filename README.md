# MoodPicker - Resources

This branch contains some resources.

## Fake full database

If you want to have a full database, copy the file [mood_picker_2013.db](https://github.com/nicolabricot/MoodMicker/tree/resources/data/mood_picker_2013.db) into the `data` folder of your application and rename it on `mood_picker.db`.  
Then launch your webserver, and go to page Details. Select the year 2013 to display a full year moods.
